HOW TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER:

connect to the IP of the server, connect to port 20276

The server will send a message to greet you:
>	send help

Authenticate by answering accordingly: (the message must at least start with this phrase)
>	no help

If you fail to authenticate, the connection will be terminated by the server.
If you are successfully authenticated, the server will send you the following message:

1. You are a sensor application that will send measurement data. Answer with the following:
>	sensor friend
2. You are a phone application that will send images and receive information. Answer with the following:
>	phone friend

After you have authenticated and identified yourself, you can freely communicate with the server.
